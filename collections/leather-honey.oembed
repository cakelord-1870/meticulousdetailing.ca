Keep in mind that new leather items do not need to be cleaned.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the leather is clean and dry, test the leather conditioner in a small, discreet area. It is essential to allow the leather adequate time to dry after cleaning – you don’t want to seal in water by conditioning damp leather, which may lead to mildew.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a Lint-Free Application Cloth, apply a thin, even coat to the surface of your leather item. Let it absorb for a minimum of two hours – preferably overnight — then wipe off any excess using another dry lint-free cloth. With a half-pint bottle, you will be able to apply Leather Honey to small accessories several times as needed, because a little goes a long way.
