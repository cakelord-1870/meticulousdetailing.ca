<p>This is a set of our softest brushes for use with automotive trim and upholstery. With a brush from each of our shape types, almost every mess is within your reach!</p>
<ul>
<li>The 4 inch flat brush is best used on large flat areas like door panels and windshields.</li>
<li>The bullet-shaped original brush can get into curved spaces like armrests and the contours of seats. It’s also great for tight corners and cupholders.</li>
<li>The 2 inch detail brush is best for small spots that get missed or need special attention. Instead of spending time and effort scrubbing small messes, just grab our 2 inch brush and let your joints rest easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These Drill brushes  are designed for use in your cordless drill. No need to buy a one-trick scrubbing tool to sit around gathering dust. The higher speed and power of a cordless drill allows you to cut through messes up to twice as fast as hand scrubbing. While our competitors’ brushes often break under heavy loads, these are built to last!</p>
<p>Each brush features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our low stiffness non-scratch nylon bristles</li>
<li>A steel shaft with rust resistant nickel plating</li>
<li>A strong polypropylene plastic block for high durability</li>
<li>A 1/4 inch quick change shaft for use in any drill or impact driver</li>
</ul>
<p>All the brushes use our white soft stiffness bristles, and are designed not to leave scratches on most surfaces even under heavy use.</p>
