<div class="rte text--pull" data-mce-fragment="1">Micro-Restore detergent is an optimized blend of chelating agents, surfactants, and builders in an aqueous system. This microfiber wash detergent provides excellent cleaning performance to effectively remove stubborn soils and oily residue from microfiber, cotton and chamois material. Micro-Restore microfiber detergent emulsifies dirty motor oil, greasy soils, car wax and protein stains, and suspends them for complete removal in the rinse cycle. This microfiber towel detergent restores like new performance through several hundred cleanings. <br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Why is Micro-Restore better than your common household detergent?</span><br data-mce-fragment="1">Micro-Restore microfiber cleaning solution is better than your common household detergent because most detergents and laundry soaps have some form of bleach and fabric softener included in their formulas (even when they say they don't there are small traces). Over time bleach breaks down the micro-fibers, and fabric softeners clog the microscopic pours that make microfiber so effective, rendering the microfiber product less effective with each washing.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Not only will Micro-Restore detergent extend the life of your microfiber, but the microfiber cleaning solution's special blend of cheleating agents, surfactants, and builders will more effectively remove the heavy residue (wax, oil, grease, break dust, and other chemicals) that becomes implanted in microfiber products when used in heavy cleaning situations (car care).<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Directions:</span><span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span>Add 2 ounces of microfiber detergent to standard size (8 gallon) loads. For larger loads or heavily soiled laundry, add 3-6 ounces. As a prespotter: dilute 1 part microfiber detergent concentrate with 3 parts water. Apply to stain and launder as usual.<br data-mce-fragment="1">

<p><span>Washing microfiber towels is pretty easy, there are just a few things that you should remember to keep your products effective and long lasting</span><span>. You can wash and dry your microfiber products in your household washer and dryer, with warm water and low heat.</span></p>
<p><span>Microfiber towel washing instructions to keep your microfiber "like new":</span></p>
<span>
<li>Do not use Bleach</li>
<li>Do not use Fabric Softener</li>
<li>Do not wash with other cotton products.</li>
</span><span></span>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Microfiber products do not like bleach. Washing microfiber towels with bleach breaks down the polyester and polyamide micro-filaments, rendering them less effective. </span><br><span>Fabric softeners provide a layer of "softeness" on your clothing, which is nice for clothing that you wear, but this coating clogs the microfibers, rendering them less effective.</span><br><span>It is not that microfiber products do not like cotton products or other fabrics, it is that when you are cleaning microfiber cloth with your cotton products the microfiber will grab and hold onto the lint that the cotton produces. So if you do not want your microfiber towels to lint then you should not wash them with cotton products. </span><span>Follow these microfiber washing instructions to keep your towels and sponges in pristine condition.</span><br><br><span>Some users of microfiber, automotive, janitorial, need a more effective way of cleaning microfiber cloths to remove dirt, grime, oils, and etc. from their microfiber towels, and Household detergents just don't do the job. </span><span>Many users like to keep their microfibers in pristine condition. </span><span>For high quality microfiber towel care, there is the original <a href="https://www.microfibertech.com/Micro-Restore-Microfiber-Detergent.html" target="_blank">Micro Restore</a> Microfiber Detergent.</span></p>
