<p> </p>
<p><span>Wowo</span>’s QUICK DETAILER is the perfect combination of gloss, slickness, and ease of use in one bottle. If the scent doesn’t win you over, the results will! Simply spray QUICK DETAILER onto the exterior of your vehicle and wipe off with a Premium Microfiber Towel. Flip the towel as needed. We recommend applying it to one panel at a time and enjoy the process (and the fantastic smell)! It can be used for light dusting, lubricant as a drying aid, or on a freshly washed vehicle for added shine. The result will be a high gloss, hydrophobic finish with deep color enhancement.
