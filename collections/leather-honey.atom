Our Leather Honey Leather Cleaner <span data-mce-fragment="1">is the leading non-toxic cleaning product for leather, vinyl, rubber, plastic and faux leather. </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Leather items take a regular beating. Motorcycle seats are constantly exposed to road-grit and grime. Tack is exposed to the dirt in the arena and sweat from the horse’s back. Leather apparel is subject to spills and stains. When that dirt and debris begins to take a toll on your leather belongings, you need a way to clean it. Enter Leather Leather Honey Cleaner.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Finally, an All-Natural Leather Honey Cleaner You Can Trust</b></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Leather Honey Leather Cleaner was formulated to comply with our company’s high standards.  The product is completely natural and non-toxic, offering a safe, gentle way to clean all leather but suede.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Concentrated Product Saves You Money</b></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Leather Honey Cleaner comes in a concentrated four-ounce bottle. This format is by design, as it helps save our customers money. One four-ounce bottle of Leather Honey Leather Cleaner will add up to two 16-ounce spray bottles of mixed cleaner when diluted. Diluting the concentrate is simple: Just mix it with water in a one to eight ratio: One ounce of cleaner (two tablespoons) per eight ounces (one cup) of water. As with Leather Honey Leather Conditioner, a little goes a long way. One small bottle could last several years on your shelf.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Leather Honey's Leather Conditioner is a non-toxic, all-natural leather conditioner designed to infuse leather with necessary moisture.</p>
<p>Leather is a natural material, and as such it requires frequent hydration to stay beautiful and soft. When left untreated, leather dries out and becomes brittle. Leather Honey Leather Conditioner is designed to restore that moisture, protecting new leather and restoring old leather. Leather Honey Leather Conditioner comes in a wide range of sizes to meet a variety of needs.</p>
<p>When purchasing, choose the bottle size that best matches the task at hand. The half-pint bottle is perfect for smaller items. Use for Accessories and Small Apparel Because a little Leather Honey Leather Conditioner goes a long way, the half-pint bottle is more than enough product for small leather accessories and medium-sized items. Customers commonly purchase the half-pint bottle for:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
	<li>
	<p>Wallets</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Belts</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Shoes</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Baseball gloves</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Purses and handbags</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the condition of your leather, a half-pint may also be enough for a small leather jacket or a pair of leather work boots. Often, treating a jacket takes just four ounces, while a pair of brand-new work boots may require only two ounces.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use Leather Honey</strong></p>
<p>Once you receive your bottle of Leather Honey Leather Conditioner, using it is quite simple. First, clean your leather using Leather Honey Leather Cleaner to remove any grit and grime build up. Keep in mind that new leather items do not need to be cleaned.</p>
<p>Once the leather is clean and dry, test the leather conditioner in a small, discreet area. It is essential to allow the leather adequate time to dry after cleaning – you don’t want to seal in water by conditioning damp leather, which may lead to mildew.</p>
<p>Using a Lint-Free Application Cloth, apply a thin, even coat to the surface of your leather item. Let it absorb for a minimum of two hours – preferably overnight — then wipe off any excess using another dry lint-free cloth. With a half-pint bottle, you will be able to apply Leather Honey to small accessories several times as needed, because a little goes a long way. Keep your wallets, boots, car seats and handbags conditioned with Leather Honey Leather Conditioner.</p></td>
