The glossy, liquid-like shimmer enhances all types and colors of paint. No other synthetic wax or paint sealant gives your vehicle the gloss, the depth, and the protection of Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant. Now with fortified polymer technology, Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant is simply the best paint sealant you'll ever use.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Wolfgang Concours Series collection is built around this single product. Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant was developed in order to meet the demand for a paint protectant that captures the wet look of a carnauba wax but lasts longer. Immediately, we looked to the newest breed of crystalline \"super\" polymers being developed in Germany. German Super Polymers were the foundation of their original groundbreaking formula.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant features fortified polymer technology. Wolfgang's German Super Polymers are fortified with more dirt-repelling power to keep your vehicle cleaner and shinier, longer. Our enhanced super polymers have an amazing anti-static property that repels water, oil, dust, and road grime to provide unsurpassed paint protection. Your vehicle stays cleaner because foreign molecules literally slide off the clear polymer coating. Super polymers bond easily to automotive paint and form an extensive cross-linked polymer network. This clear shield eliminates surface tension so contaminants have no foothold on your vehicle.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp align=\"left\"\u003eThe network of slick super polymers increases the paint's \"jetting factor\". Jetting factor is another word for decreased surface tension. No other paint sealant matches Wolfgang's jetting factor. Regular washing with Wolfgang Auto Bathe will allow dirt to slide right off the paint.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look of Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant is similar to the shine of a carnauba wax but with a slicker, wetter surface gloss. The paint looks like a clear glossy coating was just poured over it. The paint ripples with reflections and light bounces off every angle and curve. The crystal-like structure of the German Super Polymers yields an incredible, vivid shine - not a sterile, surface shine. The crystals refract light much like high-quality diamonds. Any color is enhanced by Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant replicates the best qualities of carnauba wax – slickness and shine – but it has more than double the longevity of the average carnauba wax. Just a few drops will produce a show-stealing shine that withstands the elements, ultraviolet rays, infrared radiation, salt water, and environmental pollutants and armors your paint for months. Plus, Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant is an excellent value. A little goes a long way.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant was created to meet any car care challenge. It stands up to extreme temperatures, road salt, salty ocean air, ozone, and moisture. Apply it in hot, humid conditions – Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant will deliver a streak-free shine every time. Apply it just before the onset of winter and your vehicle will be protected until spring!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTech Note:\u003c\/strong\u003e Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant is a water-based, oxygen activated paint sealant. After buffing off the sealant, the remaining coating needs to cure for 12 hours in dry conditions to fully bond to the paint. Exposure to moisture during this time will drown the polymers. For the best results, allow 12 hours of curing time.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Wolfgang","offers":[{"title":"16oz","offer_id":32380590719036,"sku":"WG-5500","price":52.99,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0266\/9880\/9404\/products\/wolfgang-sealant-16oz-wolfgang-deep-gloss-paint-sealant-14916259381308.jpg?v=1614061668"},{"product_id":"wolfgang-paintwork-polish-enhancer","title":"Wolfgang Paintwork Polish Enhancer","description":"\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently polishes paint to a deep gloss! Wolfgang Paintwork Polish Enhancer is your last chance to create a memorable gloss before wax application. Wolfgang's pre-wax cleanser removes old waxes and sealants, light oxidation, and paint contamination to reveal deep color and gloss.

If you want the ultimate gloss, it starts with Wolfgang Paintwork Polish Enhancer!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfgang Paintwork Polish Enhancer is truly in a class of its own. Most car polishes get their shine-power from potent VOC solvents—not exactly kind to paintwork. Our Paintwork Polish Enhancer is a mild oil-in-water emulsion. This prewax cleansing lotion will not dull or dry the paint, even with dedicated use. Wolfgang's gentle, water-based formula is ideal to use on expensive finishes and antique, collectible, and show cars.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfgang Paintwork Polish Enhancer does not level or abrade the paint. It is a moisturizing cleansing lotion that uncovers the shimmering gloss of like-new paint by removing dull layers of old wax and surface impurities. Micro-fine fillers settle into light swirls and scratches to create a smooth, level surface. Minor imperfections will disappear. The removal of old paint protection will encourage maximum bonding and gloss of Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant or Wolfgang Füzion Estate Wax. This combination of products will leave your vehicle with an absolutely stunning shine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUse Wolfgang Paintwork Polish Enhancer before using Wolfgang Deep Gloss Paint Sealant for the first time.
