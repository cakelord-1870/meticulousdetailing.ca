<p data-mce-fragment="1">MTM Hydro's Stainless Steel Plugs offer a fast and upgraded QC system for your high pressure joints which are great for quickly disconnecting hose lines, spray guns, or any pressure washing attachments. MTM Hydro boasts a premium Stainless Steel line of fittings that ensures our customers a worry free cleaning experience with anti-corrosive properties and ultra reliable performance. They are commonly found at all joints where high pressure fluid may need to be disconnected after use. Other areas such as lances, tips, and foam cannons are convenient places to install these QC's and with MTM Hydro's stringent Quality Control you will not have to worry about locking balls falling out, missing O-rings, or collars that do not fully engage.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">As a rule of thumb, MTM Hydro 1/4" fittings are normally found at the end of the pressure washing system on the spray wand or outlet of the spray gun. When purchasing plugs and couplers the Male model has exposed threads while the Female version has threads on the interior of the fitting. See image for reference.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">All MTM Stainless Plugs are National Pipe Thread (NPT) which means they have a tapered Male or Female thread (depending upon the model). NPT is mainly used in the Western Hemisphere and was developed on the concept of interference by the third thread. When installing NPT fittings to another NPT thread we recommend that you use 4-5 wraps of teflon tape wound clockwise, or 2-3 drops of Loctite thread sealant.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">British Standard Pipe Thread (BSP) is found in the European market and has a different thread pitch than NPT. BSP is also considered a 'straight thread' which means it has no taper at the end. When installing NPT on BSP or vice versa, use 6-7 wraps of Teflon or 2-3 drops of Loctite and tighten accordingly. When tightening oposing thread styles (BSP and NPT) you will experience more interference sooner and you will not be able to tighten the fitting as far as like-threads. You will still have a tight seal, just make sure to use the recommended amount of Teflon Tape or Loctite.</p>

<p class="" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1580415797232_492">MTM Hydro's Italian Manufactured PF22.2 Foam Cannon is the new standard in the foaming industry and stands alone as the most reliable foam Cannon in the industry. With its new standing bottle you no longer have to worry about spills and tipping over. Whether you are foaming down your car on the weekend or you are a professional contract cleaner foaming hog barn for hours, this tool will save you time and money. Simply attach the foam cannon to your pressure washer using one of the included fittings, fill with your desired ratio of chemical in the calibrated standing bottle and you are up and running.</p>
<p class="">NOTE A specific 1/4" Male plug may be required in order to attach the QC plug to the end of some residential pressure washer setups. MTM Hydro 1/4" plugs are standard for industrial use but many residential pressure washers such as Generac, Greenworks, Ryobi, AR Blue Clean,etc... have certain models where the coupler will not receive an MTM plug. Not all of these brands are impacted, just certain models. If you look closely, the Chamfer at the end of an MTM plug as well as the neck is, 1.5mm shorter than some couplers may allow. We now offer this new Low Profile QC plug under item #24.5006. Once you install the correct plug in your new MTM Foam Cannon, you sill see that it was worth finding this specialized fitting as our foam cannons are second to none, even when manufactures try to change their fittings!</p>

<p class="">Note: The full spectrum of ratings are not supported by the 3.5 or 3.0 orifices included with this kit. Other orifices may be required for higher flow machines that have lower PSI- Example: 2000 PSI with 3.5 GPM requires a 5.0 Orifice. For larger orifices, you will know it does not work because you will experience starting and stopping of the foam cannon as your unloader slips in and out of bypass. You will also get watery foam as the orifice size 3.5 is significantly smaller than the 5.0 needed for your machine. MTM Foam Cannons will not work with flow sensing unloaders as you will experience the same results listed for an under-sized orifice. See below for additional orifice sizes and replacement items available for purchase. </p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">Simply slide the swivel end of your Kobrajet hose through the opening provided at the side of the reel core and install the 3/8" Male NPT threads into the 3/8" Female NPT threads of the swivel. Do not make a Quick Coupling joint at the swivel as there is not enough space and the bend in the line is too severe. Be sure to allow a small amount of slack at the swivel joint and use the red hose fastener provided to secure the hose at this joint. Using a Whip Line connected to your pump, connect to the 3/8" Male NPT hose reel inlet. When planning, add an extra foot to the distance so as not to bend the Whip Line too severely. Lastly, install the handle with the hardware provided.</p>

<p>The Acqualine series by MTM offers industrial cleaning applications a new option for material specific jobs. This series of product is manufactured with high grade AISI 316 Stainless for added corrosion resistance and zero leeching of hard metals into potable water. The vented blue lance is BPA free and allows you to use either Hot or Cold water. Vented lances are also a fraction of the weight when compared to a traditional molded grip lance leading to longer cleaning times less fatigue.</p>
<p>When considering bent or straight lances, it is widely known that a bent lance allows a more perpendicular approach for your spray pattern to clean valleys on hard surfaces. This bend allows for the pressurized stream to enter the entire cleaning surface as opposed to one side, especially with porous materials such as concrete. For vehicle cleaning, the bend creates a water blade that pushes debris away from the cleaning surface.</p></td>

This technique guarantees that your hose ends will stay in place and will not rupture or blow off during pressure spikes.

<p>MTM Hydro's 5 Pack of Stainless QC Nozzles offer superior performance and extended life as a result of our refined manufacturing process. This premium nozzle pack has Soap, 0°, 15°, 25°, and 40° Stainless QC Nozzles that are 100% tested for orifice accuracy and degree setting so you never have to worry about using an inaccurate nozzle. In addition to the meticulous testing process, MTM Hydro nozzles are manufactured with striations in the stainless steel to securely hold the pressed head of the nozzle and eliminate the possibility of the coloured head falling off, as with competing models. All MTM Hydro nozzles are laser etched along the neck with degree and size of the nozzle. For reference: 25045 translates to 25<span>° </span>size 4.5 orifice.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1580415797505_357">MTM Foam Cannon Hydro's Italian Magnum 28 Foam Cannon Kit has the newest Foam Cannon in the Industry paired with the newest Spray Gun in the industry. The stylish and robust SGS28 Spray Gun with integrated Stainless Live Swivel is now paired with Stainless fittings and the PF22 Foam Cannon to give you a premium Italian Foam Kit that is unmatched by any other. Complete with the New Stand Up bottle, this kit is unrivaled. Whether you are foaming down your car on the weekend or you are a professional contract cleaner washing multiple vehicles per day, this tool will save you time and money.  Simply attach the foam cannon to your pressure washer using one of the included fittings, fill with your desired ratio of chemical and you are up and running. The snub style Magnum28 Kit allows you to fit in tight spaces when cleaning and eliminates reaching 40"" away to adjust your cannon settings.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1580415797505_360">The MTM Foam Cannon Hydro PF22 launched in 2017 as the latest and greatest foam cannon to hit the world stage. The PF22 offers both, adjustable fan blades, and a two stage nozzle allowing you to spray vertically and horizontally. By adjusting the fan blades (narrow or jet) MTM Hydro Foam cannons throw thick foam onto your vehicle, pole barn siding, house, fence, sidewalk, roof or other washable items. The chemical injection knob on top of the PF22 also clicks and allows for precise measurement of more or less chemical to be drawn through the internal chamber, increasing or decreasing the foam output. This allows the internal agitator to create a dense foam that is stickier than the chinese knock off foam cannons. In doing so, this thick foam has a longer dwell time which allows the chemical to work on the cleaning surface for longer in its effort to emulsify the dirt and grime. some surfaces may still require some elbow grease, however, if the chemical does its job, very little (if any) scrubbing is required.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1580415797232_492">MTM Foam Cannon is an Italian Manufactured PF22.2 Foam Cannon is the new standard in the foaming industry and stands alone as the most reliable foam Cannon in the industry. With its new standing bottle you no longer have to worry about spills and tipping over. Whether you are foaming down your car on the weekend or you are a professional contract cleaner foaming hog barn for hours, this tool will save you time and money. Simply attach the foam cannon to your pressure washer using one of the included fittings, fill with your desired ratio of chemical in the calibrated standing bottle and you are up and running.</p>
<p>The MTM Foam Cannon Hydro PF22 launched in 2017 as the latest and greatest foam cannon to hit the world stage. The PF22 offers both, adjustable fan blades, and a two stage nozzle allowing you to spray vertically and horizontally. By adjusting the fan blades (narrow or jet) MTM Hydro Foam cannons throw thick foam onto your vehicle, pole barn siding, house, fence, sidewalk, roof or other washable items. The chemical injection knob on top of the PF22 also clicks and allows for precise measurement of more or less chemical to be drawn through the internal chamber, increasing or decreasing the foam output. This allows the internal agitator to create a dense foam that is stickier than the Chinese knock-off foam cannons. In doing so, this thick foam has a longer dwell time which allows the chemical to work on the cleaning surface for longer in its effort to emulsify the dirt and grime. some surfaces may still require some elbow grease, however, if the chemical does its job, very little (if any) scrubbing is required.</p>
<p>NOTE A specific 1/4" Male plug may be required in order to attach the QC plug to the end of some residential pressure washer setups. MTM Hydro 1/4" plugs are standard for industrial use but many residential pressure washers such as Generac, Greenworks, Ryobi, AR Blue Clean,etc... have certain models where the coupler will not receive an MTM plug. Not all of these brands are impacted, just certain models. If you look closely, the Chamfer at the end of an MTM plug as well as the neck is, 1.5mm shorter than some couplers may allow. We now offer this new Low Profile QC plug under item #24.5006. Once you install the correct plug in your new MTM Foam Cannon, you sill see that it was worth finding this specialized fitting as our foam cannons are second to none, even when manufactures try to change their fittings!</p>

<p>Note: The full spectrum of ratings are not supported by the 3.5 or 3.0 orifices included with this kit. Other orifices may be required for higher flow machines that have lower PSI- Example: 2000 PSI with 3.5 GPM requires a 5.0 Orifice. For larger orifices, you will know it does not work because you will experience starting and stopping of the foam cannon as your unloader slips in and out of bypass. You will also get watery foam as the orifice size 3.5 is significantly smaller than the 5.0 needed for your machine. MTM Foam Cannons will not work with flow sensing unloaders as you will experience the same results listed for an under-sized orifice. See below for additional orifice sizes and replacement items available for purchase. </p>
