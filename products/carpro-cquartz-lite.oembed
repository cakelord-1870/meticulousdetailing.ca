CQuartz Lite does not need to be left to cure on the surface so should be removed immediately. Check well with an appropriate light source to ensure you remove any high spots or residues.\u003cbr\u003e\nNote: for a limited time after application, high spots that were not removed immediately can be corrected by applying more CQuartz Lite on that area and wiping off immediately.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5) After paint is free of residue, leave to dry for 4 hours prior to getting wet. Any water drops during first 48h should be removed before drying to prevent water spotting. We also recommend the use of CarPro Reload 1 hour after application to protect from water spots during first 48h.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"CarPro","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":31897940066364,"sku":null,"price":71.99,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0266\/9880\/9404\/products\/carpro-ceramic-carpro-cquartz-lite-14213235212348.jpg?v=1614160432","url":"https:\/\/meticulousdetailing.ca\/products\/carpro-cquartz-lite","provider":"Meticulous Detailing Inc.","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
